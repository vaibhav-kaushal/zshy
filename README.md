# zshy

zshy is a small framework written for my personal workflow. While I love ohmyzsh and all the goodies, I do not use most of it (except the awesome history navigation features). I like scripts and functions which are descriptive much more than shortcodes which are not self-explanatory and can cause havoc when you forget what they do. I also do not like remembering really complicated set of command line options, switches, arguments and their orders. I like help along the way. I do not want fancy UI for most of the stuff and would rather prefer to have a guided menu driven interaction; why? because they do not depend on fancy fetures being enabled and even a barebones environment like a Docker container should be able to take advantage of scripts that I write.

Zshy thus is a(n extremely) opinionated set of scripts with the above set of behavior (rather 'preferences', really) baked right in. It is a half-work of art. It is not complete and there might be risks.
